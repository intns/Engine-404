### Brief Overview

Engine 404 is a project that replicates Pikmin gameplay in the Unity game engine. This repository also aims to serve as a valuable resource for developers interested in implementing Pikmin-like gameplay mechanics into their own projects.

This project is no longer in active development for the foreseeable future.
